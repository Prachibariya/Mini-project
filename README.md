As part of my academic coursework, I developed a web-based Inventory
Management System aimed at streamlining product stocking and management.
2024.The system was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. It allows
users to manage product entries, categories and sales reports. The system provided insightful features such as stock , product categorization,
and sales reporting, contributing to better inventory control and management.
